# nextcloud-deck-api


Interact with the [Deck application for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck) using Ruby.

Implementation based on [Deck's API documentation](https://deck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/).

  * `DECK_API_PASSWORD`: The password associated with the aforementioned user;
  * `DECK_API_DOMAIN`: The domain where the Nextcloud instance is accessible at.

```ruby
require 'nextcloud-deck-api'

# get the list of the boards
boards = DeckAPI::Boards.get

# get the list of stacks of the board of id 42
stacks = DeckAPI::Stacks.get 42

# add a card to the stack of id 43 of the board of id 42
card = Card(title: 'Title of the card'
            description: 'A description of what this card is about',
            board_id: 42,
            stack_id: 43)
DeckAPI::Cards.create card
```
